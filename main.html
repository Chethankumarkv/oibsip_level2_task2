         <h2>Early Life</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="earlyDiscription">
         Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of
         Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the
         same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from
         which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property
         tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to
         the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a
         living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.India’s first
         intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. <br>
         Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to learn. He
         spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher
         secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From
         Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace
         engineering at Madras Institute of Technology. <br>

         <h2>Career as a scientist</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="careerDiscription">
         After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development
         Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of
         India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started
         his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam
         joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and
         recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station
         (TERLS). In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the
         project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini
         satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
         independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to
         include more engineers.
         <br>
         Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and
         Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during
         this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
         Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this
         period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K
         Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect
         report. Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.
